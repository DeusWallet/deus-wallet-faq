# How to Add a BEP20 or BEP2 Token to Your Balance

Users can add any Binance Smart Chain (BEP20) or Binance Chain (BEP2) token to their wallet using the Coin Manager icon on the Balance tab.

From the Coin Manager screen, users can either search for and activate the token or add it manually using the "Add Token" option.
