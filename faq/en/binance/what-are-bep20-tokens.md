# What are BEP20 Tokens?

BEP20 is Binance Smart Chain's equivalent of Ethereum's ERC20 token standard. If you're unfamiliar with this concept, you can learn more about it in the Ethereum section.

It's important to note that your address for receiving BNB on Binance Smart Chain or any BEP20 tokens will always remain the same.
