# What is Binance Smart Chain?

Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain that closely resembles the Ethereum blockchain but with key differences. It operates as a separate blockchain with its own cryptocurrency token, Binance Coin (BNB), and its own ecosystem.

BSC gained popularity due to high usage and congestion on the Ethereum blockchain, which led to expensive transaction fees.

BSC offers significantly cheaper transactions because it uses a fixed number of privileged validator nodes to process transactions. This semi-centralized approach makes the network faster, though it reduces decentralization and security.

Key points to remember when interacting with the BSC ecosystem:

- It is a standalone blockchain with a semi-centralized architecture.
- It has its own cryptocurrency token (BNB) and ecosystem.
- Transaction fees are paid in BNB tokens.
- It allows for fast and inexpensive transactions.

BSC has quickly attracted numerous projects and has developed a thriving ecosystem of decentralized services.
