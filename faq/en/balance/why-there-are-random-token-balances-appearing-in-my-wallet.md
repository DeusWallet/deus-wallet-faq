### Why are there random token balances appearing in my wallet?

It's not uncommon for new cryptocurrency projects to "airdrop" tokens to the community. This is done to attract interest and distribute tokens widely. Some projects airdrop tokens to selected users based on specific criteria, while others may send them to anyone with an Ethereum balance. Since all Ethereum addresses are public on the blockchain, anyone can send ETH or tokens to these addresses without any preconditions.

While some airdrops can be valuable (e.g., Uniswap or 1inch airdrops), most of the airdropped tokens have no value and can be ignored. Occasionally, tokens are airdropped purely for spam purposes.
