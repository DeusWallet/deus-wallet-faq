### Why is the wallet balance showing an incorrect amount?

There are several reasons why your wallet balance may display an incorrect amount:

- **Missing Exchange Rates:** If the exchange rate for a cryptocurrency is missing, its value is not reflected in the total balance amount.

- **Incorrect Exchange Rates:** If the exchange rate for a cryptocurrency is incorrect, both the balance for that coin and the total balance amount will be displayed incorrectly.

- **Synchronization with the Blockchain:** As the app synchronizes with the blockchain, the balance for coins and the total balance amount will change depending on the synchronization progress.

- **Unconfirmed Transactions:** If there is an incoming transaction that hasnâ€™t reached finality, the balance may appear incorrect. For certain currencies like Bitcoin, a certain amount of time needs to pass before the recently received amount becomes spendable. For Bitcoin, for example, Deus requires 3 blocks (approximately 30 minutes) to pass before newly received Bitcoins can be spent.

Additionally, the balance for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, and Zcash may sometimes be shown incorrectly if the Deus wallet fails to correctly identify an incoming transaction. In such cases, you can report the issue to the Deus team, and it will be addressed as a priority.
