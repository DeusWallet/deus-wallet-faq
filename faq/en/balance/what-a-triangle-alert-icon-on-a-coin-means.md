# What Does a Triangle Alert Icon on a Coin Mean?

The triangle alert icon on a coin indicates that the Deus app was unable to synchronize with the given blockchain.

1. **For Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, or Zcash:** 
   - Click on the alert icon and try one of the available action buttons, such as retry or sync source change.
   - If the sync error persists, another option is to delete the wallet and restore it from scratch.

2. **For Ethereum (including ERC20 tokens) and Binance Smart Chain (including BEP20 tokens):**
   - This issue is usually due to communication errors with Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain data providers.
   - Retrying the sync after waiting a few minutes typically resolves the issue.
   - If the problem continues, try killing and restarting the app.

Please note that a synchronization error means the Deus wallet app is having trouble syncing with the blockchain. This does not affect the funds in your wallet in any way.
