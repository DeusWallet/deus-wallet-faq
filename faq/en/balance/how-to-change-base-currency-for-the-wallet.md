# How to Change Base Currency

By default, Deus displays all balance and transaction amounts in USD. Users can change the base currency from USD to another fiat currency in the wallet settings.

The crypto to fiat (USD, EUR, etc.) exchange rates are provided by a third-party service, [coingecko.com](https://coingecko.com).

While Deus collaborates with reliable data providers, the wallet cannot guarantee that the returned rates are always accurate real-time rates. Please be aware of this when transacting large sums.
