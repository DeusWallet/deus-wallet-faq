### What Does the 'Syncing' Status on a Coin Mean?

The 'syncing' status on a coin indicates that the Deus app is attempting to synchronize with the respective blockchain.

While 'syncing' usually appears briefly, there are several scenarios where it may take significantly longer:

- **Initial Synchronization:** When restoring a wallet with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Litecoin, or Zcash, syncing can take several hours per coin if the wallet is restored from the blockchain instead of a third-party API service. The more coins being restored, the longer the process takes.

- **First-Time Activation:** Activating Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Litecoin, or Zcash for the first time after setting up the wallet can also lead to prolonged syncing.

- **Infrequent App Usage:** Opening the wallet app after several days or weeks of inactivity can trigger a longer syncing process.

- **Poor Network Conditions:** Slow internet or unstable network connections can extend syncing times.

- **Slow RPC Response Times:** Delays or slow responses from Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain RPC providers can cause extended syncing. Itâ€™s advisable to wait a few minutes or restart the wallet app in such cases.

Keep in mind, the Deus app only synchronizes while it is open. If the app is closed, synchronization pauses and resumes when the app is reopened.
