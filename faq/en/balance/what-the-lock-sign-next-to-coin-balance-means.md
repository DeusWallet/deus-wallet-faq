### What Does a Lock Icon on Coin Balance Mean?

In some cases, Deus displays a lock icon below the balance amount for a coin. This indicates that the wallet app cannot spend the entire balance of that coin.

For example, if a wallet receives a time-locked Bitcoin transaction that cannot be spent until a future date, Deus will identify these transactions and display part of the coin balance with a lock icon.
