### Why is the exchange rate for the token not shown?

Deus obtains token exchange rates from multiple third-party sources that track cryptocurrency market prices in real-time.

The current and historical rates for some tokens, particularly newly launched ones, may not be available. In such cases, Deus will not display the exchange rate for these tokens.
