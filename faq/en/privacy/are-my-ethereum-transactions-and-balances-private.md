# Are my Ethereum transactions and balances private?

Every transaction made by an address on the Ethereum blockchain is visible to anyone monitoring the blockchain.

Anyone can look up an address to see its past transactions as well as its current ETH and ERC20 token balances, revealing everything the account has ever done.

The only remaining privacy aspect is the lack of a direct link between an Ethereum address and a person's real-world identity.

To enhance privacy on Ethereum, it is advisable to use multiple wallets with distinct purposes:

- A rarely-used wallet for long-term storage that never transacts with data-collecting entities.
- A wallet for transacting with centralized exchanges and other data-collecting entities.
- A wallet for transacting with individuals.

With the right approach and some due diligence, users can achieve a certain level of privacy on Ethereum.
