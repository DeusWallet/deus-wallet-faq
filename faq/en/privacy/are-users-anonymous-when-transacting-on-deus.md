# Are users anonymous when transacting on Deus?

For the most part, users' activities on Deus remain anonymous, but several factors can impact one's privacy. These factors are generally related to internet privacy and not directly to Deus. Below are some key points to consider:

1. **Transaction Privacy**: When using Deus for transactions, a person's identity and other data remain private. Deus developers and third parties, including government agencies or financial regulators, do not have access to this information.

   However, if a user frequently interacts with non-private (regulated) crypto exchanges or other centralized wallets through Deus, there is a high likelihood that user activity on these platforms is shared with external parties. This may enable third parties to link certain addresses or transactions to the same user.

   Additionally, user data and activities on cryptocurrency exchanges (such as deposits, withdrawals, trades, and used addresses) may become publicly accessible if these platforms suffer a hacking attack.

2. **Internet Privacy**: Depending on geographical and political factors, some users might need to conceal their crypto-related activities even from their ISPs. ISPs can track browsing activities and potentially match this data with real-world identities. Visiting certain sites can inadvertently expose data, including owned addresses and token balances.

   Deus provides ways to route internet traffic through encrypted proxy channels (using VPN or TOR) at the app level, making it impossible for ISPs and similar entities to discern the context of users' internet activity when using the Deus wallet app.

3. **Cryptocurrency Privacy Levels**: Users should be aware of the different privacy levels offered by various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It's essential to understand the privacy aspects of transactions on both platforms.

   While Bitcoin offers some level of privacy, Ethereum is fully transparent. Understanding these differences is crucial for developing a reliable privacy strategy.

The points above are not exhaustive and there are additional advanced privacy considerations to be aware of.
