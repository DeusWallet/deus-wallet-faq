# Is it Safe to Share Data with Exchanges and Other Service Providers?

Nearly all regulated cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers must perform thorough Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks for each customer they serve.

The amount of information these service providers request varies based on factors such as the customer's location, the service provider's location, and the nature of the business.

Anyone planning to handle large amounts of cryptocurrency should anticipate undergoing these checks with cryptocurrency exchanges, banks, and similar entities.

Points to consider:

- The business entity conducting the check might be compromised, potentially leaking users' private data. Therefore, it is advisable to choose more established entities.
  
- The business entity conducting the check might share user information with other entities. Those seeking privacy might consider using service providers located outside their own jurisdiction.
