# Are my Bitcoin transactions and balance private?

While all Bitcoin transactions are visible on the blockchain, linking different transactions to the same entity is not always straightforward.

Bitcoin allows the use of unique addresses for each incoming payment, offering significantly more privacy compared to Ethereum. This is why Deus wallet automatically changes the deposit address after each payment. This method makes it much harder for anyone monitoring the blockchain to identify a user's balance and past transactions.

For enhanced privacy, similar to Ethereum, it's advisable to use multiple wallets with distinct purposes:

- A rarely-used wallet for long-term storage that never transacts with data-collecting entities.
- A wallet for transacting with centralized exchanges and other data-collecting entities.
- A wallet for transacting with individuals.

In addition to using unique addresses for each incoming payment, wallets like Deus also offer advanced privacy-enhancing features related to transaction structuring.
