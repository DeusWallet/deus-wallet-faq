# Enhancing Privacy with TOR and VPN

Using features like TOR (available on Android) and VPN (coming soon) in Deus significantly enhances privacy by breaking the link between a user's internet activity and their physical identity at the level of the internet provider.

Without these masking features, a user's activities, such as the websites they visit, are clearly visible to their internet service provider.

If someone's internet activity is being tracked, the absence of such features could unintentionally expose their cryptocurrency addresses and token balances simply by visiting a block explorer website to look up address activity. Typically, people search for their own addresses.

For individuals living in authoritarian environments, these privacy-enhancing capabilities can be particularly beneficial.
