# How Deus is Different from Crypto Exchange Wallets

Most wallets provided by cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, Poloniex, and Bittrex are custodial. These are not true cryptocurrency wallets and do not offer independence, privacy, or control over funds.

In practical terms, users of these wallets:

- Are fully dependent on the exchange to access their funds.
- Can lose access to their wallet at the sole discretion of the exchange.
- Risk losing their funds if the exchange gets hacked.
- Have limited control over their privacy (data can be leaked).
- Must go through identity checks and KYC/AML procedures.

In contrast, when using a non-custodial wallet like Deus, users retain full control over their funds. Access to funds is unconditional and uninterruptible, independent of any exchange or third party.
