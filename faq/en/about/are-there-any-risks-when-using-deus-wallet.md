# What risks are there when using Deus?

Deus Wallet cannot interfere with users' funds or restrict app usage. The user retains complete control over their assets.

As a non-custodial, private, and decentralized wallet, Deus empowers users with full control.

However, with this control comes full responsibility. Users are solely responsible for the safety of their funds. If issues arise, there is no entity to compensate for losses.

Deus's key wallet features operate independently of any centrally managed servers or infrastructure controlled by the Deus team.

Potential risks include:

- **Unexpected software bugs:** Deus's open code allows for examination and verification. However, undiscovered issues may still lead to unexpected app behavior.
  
- **Poor security practices:** Users' poor security practices, such as rooting their phone, not using a device PIN lock, keeping the OS outdated, or installing apps from unauthorized sources, can create problems.

- **Using an unofficial app:** Always update or install the Deus app from official resources to avoid risks.

- **Incorrect metadata:** Outdated exchange rates in the app can cause issues. Deus relies on third-party services for current market rates, which might differ from global rates. When sending large amounts in cryptocurrency, it's safer to enter the amount in cryptocurrency rather than its fiat equivalent.

- **Private key security:** Users should never share their wallet private keys (12-24 word mnemonic phrase) with anyone, including the Deus team. Any wallet app issues can be resolved without needing the private key.
