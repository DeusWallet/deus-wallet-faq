# What Happens if the Deus App Goes Down?

The Deus wallet app is designed to be resilient and does not rely on centrally managed servers that could disrupt its functionality. As long as there is an internet connection, the app should continue to operate normally.

However, the ability to send and receive transactions on the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain blockchains depends on communication with these blockchains via their respective RPC providers. Fully decentralized communication with these blockchains on mobile devices is currently challenging and has not yet been implemented.

In the future, Deus plans to allow users to choose their own RPC providers instead of relying on external ones.

If the Deus wallet ever stops working as expected, users can easily migrate their wallets to another non-custodial wallet app that adheres to standard compliance.
