### Does it cost anything to use Deus?

Deus Wallet is free to download and does not charge any fees for its basic features.

Users are expected to pay network usage fees when sending transactions on a given blockchain. These fees are not related to Deus and vary in real time depending on the usage of the underlying blockchain network.

The wallet app recommends a sufficient fee to ensure the transaction is processed within the expected time frame. More popular blockchains tend to be more congested, resulting in higher transaction fees.

Deus is in the process of introducing some premium features that will be available only to those holding Deus Wallet NFTs.
