## How Does Deus Make Money?

Deus is a free-to-use platform that maintains all its core features at no cost to users.

We are a self-funded group, not reliant on any external funding. Our previous ventures enable us to remain independent, innovative, and experimental while developing our preferred asset management tool for decentralized finance.

According to our roadmap, starting from versions 0.24 - 0.25, the wallet app will begin integrating premium features for power users, including:

- Advanced on-chain analytics
- Enhanced alerting features
- VIP support through private chats
- Sophisticated DeFi yield generation tools

These features are currently in the implementation stage and are designed to help the Deus team monetize and operate financially within a DAO format moving forward.

Premium wallet features will be available exclusively to those holding special Deus wallet tokens.
