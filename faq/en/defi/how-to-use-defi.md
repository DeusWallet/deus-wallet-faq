# Utilizing DeFi with Deus: A Step-by-Step Guide

Accessing DeFi services is straightforward and accessible to anyone with a cryptocurrency wallet.

Although DeFi services operate within blockchain networks, users typically interact with them via dedicated websites. These websites allow users to log in using their cryptocurrency wallets.

Deus stands out as a mobile-based cryptocurrency wallet offering seamless connectivity to any DeFi service built atop Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain blockchains through the open WalletConnect protocol.

Here's how to employ the Deus wallet with a DeFi service:

1. Visit the website of your desired DeFi service and locate the Connect/Login section.

2. Opt for WalletConnect from the available choices. This action should prompt a window displaying a QR code.

3. Launch the Deus wallet app and navigate to the Settings tab.

4. Select WalletConnect, then click on the New Session button.

5. Scan the QR code generated in step 2 to establish a connection. The connection status will be displayed on the screen. Ensure this window remains open.

6. Once the connection is established, return to the service website. You should now be successfully connected.

Any user action on the DeFi website requiring fund expenditure will necessitate confirmation within the wallet app.

- The confirmation prompt will overlay the connection status screen from step 5. Therefore, it's essential to keep this window open to view the confirmation prompt when it appears.

- If the confirmation prompt is dismissed, it can be reopened (without reconnecting) from the list of active WalletConnect sessions.

It's important to note that Ethereum DeFi transactions are typically intricate and may entail higher processing fees compared to standard token transfers.

In addition to network transaction fees, a service may impose its own charges on the user. For instance, decentralized token exchange platforms like Uniswap or Sushiswap typically levy a 0.3% fee for executing exchanges.

Given these factors, it's advisable to expect transaction fees in the range of $100 to $200.
