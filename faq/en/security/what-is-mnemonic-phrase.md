### What is a Mnemonic Phrase?

When a user creates a wallet in a non-custodial wallet app, the app prompts the user to back up the private key associated with it. This private key is usually presented as a 12 or 24-word list, known as a mnemonic phrase or seed.

The wallet owner is expected to safely store this phrase, typically offline, and use it to restore access to the wallet in cases like smartphone loss or theft.

While it is generally more secure to keep mnemonic phrases offline, there are risks involved. If someone who understands the significance of the phrase finds it, they could easily steal the wallet funds.

To minimize the risk of unauthorized access, users can enhance their private key security by adding a mnemonic passphrase. The Deus wallet app offers this feature.
