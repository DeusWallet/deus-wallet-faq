### Is Deus Less Secure Than Hardware Wallets?

While all well-engineered non-custodial wallets are considered secure, hardware wallets are generally viewed as the most secure option.

#### Key Aspects for Higher Security Scoring

1. **Cold Storage:**
   - Hardware wallets are known as cold storage wallets because they cannot connect to the internet. This lack of connectivity significantly enhances their security by reducing the potential attack surface.

2. **Special-Purpose Software:**
   - Hardware wallets run dedicated software designed to perform specific tasks. In contrast, mobile and desktop wallets operate within more complex environments that include various components such as the operating system. This complexity increases the potential attack surface for these wallets.

#### Advantages of Mobile Non-Custodial Wallets

Although hardware wallets excel in private key storage security, mobile non-custodial wallets offer other important security benefits:

1. **Privacy:**
   - Non-custodial mobile wallets like Deus can offer more privacy than hardware wallets. The process of purchasing, delivering, and setting up a hardware wallet carries privacy and security risks. For example, a recent incident involving Ledger (a leading hardware wallet brand) resulted in the exposure of customer names, phone numbers, and physical addresses.

2. **Ease of Use:**
   - Hardware wallets can be complex and limited, making them challenging for users not well-versed in cryptocurrency. They are designed for experienced users who understand how cryptocurrencies work. New users may find hardware wallets overwhelming and less user-friendly.

3. **Accessibility:**
   - Hardware wallets are not intended for frequent access. Users who need regular access to their non-custodial wallet, such as for DeFi activities, may find hardware wallets inconvenient. Mobile wallets like Deus are designed for regular use and are always just a few clicks away.

Most non-custodial wallets offer sufficient out-of-the-box security, especially if their code is open source and has been audited by multiple external entities. These wallets provide a balanced combination of security and usability, making them suitable for most regular use cases.
