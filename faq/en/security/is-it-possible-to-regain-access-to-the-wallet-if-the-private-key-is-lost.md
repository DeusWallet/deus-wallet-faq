### How to Access a Wallet if Its Private Key is Lost?

Accessing wallet funds is only possible if the user has access to the private key or its mnemonic phrase (12-24 words).

Deus functions as a gateway, allowing users to interact with blockchains and the cryptocurrencies operating on them. Control and spending of cryptocurrency on these blockchains are managed through wallet private keys stored in Deus wallets. These private keys never leave the Deus wallet app and remain solely in usersâ€™ possession.

It is the user's responsibility to back up and protect these keys from unauthorized access. Consequently, Deus cannot:

- Recover a lost private key.
- Cancel or view a user's transactions.
- Interfere with a user's tokens or wallet app.
