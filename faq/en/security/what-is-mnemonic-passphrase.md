### What is a Mnemonic Passphrase?

As an enhanced security measure, some non-custodial wallets, including Deus, allow users to secure their 12-24 word mnemonic phrase with an additional password phrase, also known as a mnemonic passphrase.

In such cases, the wallet user must back up both the mnemonic phrase and the additional passphrase. Both are required to restore access to the wallet.

Using a mnemonic passphrase adds an extra layer of security to the wallet. It ensures that even if the mnemonic phrase falls into the wrong hands, the wallet remains secure. This is similar to adding two-factor authentication to a wallet.

The advantage of a passphrase is that it can be just one word, making it easy to memorize. This feature is powerful because it helps keep users' funds safe, even if the mnemonic phrase is compromised and seen by others.
