# How Deus Keeps Funds Secure

Every non-custodial wallet, including Deus, is designed to securely store the wallet owner's private keys.

Using these keys, the wallet app can derive payment addresses for each coin, display balances, and allow the wallet owner to spend (transfer) cryptocurrency.

The Deus wallet stores private keys using secure storage mechanisms provided by the iOS and Android operating systems.

Both of these operating systems offer specialized, independent storage mediums designed to keep sensitive data (such as private keys) safe and inaccessible, even if the phone falls into unauthorized hands.
