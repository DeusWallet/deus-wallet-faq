### What Steps Should I Take If I Lose My Phone?

If you lose your phone with the wallet app installed, you can restore access to your wallet on a new device. However, if your original device did not have an unlock code or used an easy-to-guess code (such as 000000 or 123456), it is recommended to:

1. Restore your old wallet on the new device.
2. Set up a new wallet on the new device.
3. Transfer your funds from the old wallet to the new wallet.
