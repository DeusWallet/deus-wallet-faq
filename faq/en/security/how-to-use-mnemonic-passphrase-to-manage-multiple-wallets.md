## How to Use a Mnemonic Passphrase

A mnemonic passphrase boosts wallet security by adding an extra layer of protection, making it difficult for unauthorized individuals to access the wallet even if they have the mnemonic phrase.

The versatility of mnemonic passphrases allows for various creative and convenient methods to manage multiple cryptocurrency wallets. Each wallet can use the same mnemonic phrase but different mnemonic passphrases.

In the Deus app, users can create new wallets using the 'restore' option with a mnemonic phrase from another wallet and a new passphrase. This process can be repeated for multiple wallets.

As a result, users can have multiple wallets sharing the same mnemonic phrase but different passphrases:

- Wallet 1: mnemonic + passphrase1
- Wallet 2: mnemonic + passphrase2
- Wallet 3: mnemonic + passphrase3
- ...

It's important to note that if an unauthorized person gains access to the mnemonic phrase, the passphrases are the only security measure protecting the funds. Without the passphrases, the unauthorized person cannot access or even detect the existence of these wallets.

However, if a mnemonic phrase is compromised, the security of the wallet relies heavily on the strength of the chosen passphrase. Therefore, the passphrase should be a complex combination of letters and numbers, preferably long, rather than a simple English word.

In general, it is advisable to migrate to a new wallet if a wallet's mnemonic phrase has been compromised, especially by someone with technical skills. The passphrase protection provides time for the wallet owner to transfer funds to a new wallet.
