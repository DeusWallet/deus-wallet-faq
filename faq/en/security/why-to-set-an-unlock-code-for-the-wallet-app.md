### Why Should You Set an Unlock Code for the Wallet App?

Almost all non-custodial wallets, including Deus, implement security measures to protect cryptocurrency funds if a device falls into unauthorized hands.

While setting an unlock code in Deus is optional, it is highly recommended. This code ensures that private keys remain inaccessible even if an unauthorized person obtains the device and attempts to breach it using specialized tools. Similarly, it is advisable to set an unlock code for your mobile device itself.

As a best security practice, use a different unlock code for your mobile device and the Deus wallet app.
