## Understanding ERC20 Tokens

In the realm of cryptocurrency, the term typically denotes the primary currency unit native to a particular blockchain. Examples include Bitcoin and Ethereum, which serve as the primary currencies within their respective blockchain ecosystems.

However, platforms like Ethereum offer the functionality to create diverse cryptocurrencies for various purposes. These cryptocurrencies are commonly known as cryptocurrency tokens.

Ethereum, in particular, functions primarily as a platform facilitating the creation of autonomous services via smart contracts. Among these services are popular offerings such as:

- Uniswap: a token exchange platform
- MakerDAO: a lending service
- Synthetix: a derivatives trading platform

These services on Ethereum vary widely in form and utility. Many of them issue internal cryptocurrency tokens for functions like service governance, voting, or profit-sharing.

For instance:

- Uniswap introduces the UNI token
- MakerDAO offers the MKR token
- Synthetix presents the SNX token

With the increasing popularity of Ethereum, a standardized token format became necessary, leading to the emergence of the ERC20 token standard.

Today, a plethora of ERC20 tokens exist, with anyone possessing sufficient skills able to create one. These tokens constitute over half of the cryptocurrencies in circulation and are traded on exchanges alongside major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin. In essence, ERC20 tokens function as a decentralized equivalent to 'company shares' in the blockchain space.

The value of certain ERC20 tokens is often tied to the capabilities they confer upon their holders. For instance, a token granting ownership of profits from an Ethereum-based autonomous service would likely appreciate as the service gains popularity and generates profits.

The ERC20 standard is the most widely adopted token standard among Ethereum services for creating internal tokens. It delineates the fundamental characteristics and functionalities that a token should possess, including the tracking of token balances, transfer protocols, and more.
