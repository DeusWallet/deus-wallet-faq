# Why Failed Transactions Incur Transaction Fees

Completion of a transaction requires confirmation and subsequent addition to the blockchain. However, the successful completion of a transaction does not guarantee the successful execution of all its intended steps. Despite being marked as completed, a transaction might still fail to execute certain steps.

Various factors can contribute to this outcome. For instance, transactions involving the exchange of tokens often have a validity period, specifying how long the transaction conditions remain valid after user initiation. If such a transaction remains pending beyond its validity period, it can still be confirmed, yet the token exchange may not occur as intended.

Failed transactions, although unsuccessful in their intended actions, are still recorded on the blockchain and incur transaction fees. These fees are still directed to miners for the computational efforts expended. Miners within the network must validate and allocate computational resources to every transaction, irrespective of its success or failure.

Consequently, users initiating transactions bear the cost of computation, regardless of the transaction outcome.

Transaction fees are directly paid to the network and are independent of the Deus wallet, with no association between them.
