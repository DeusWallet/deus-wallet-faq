# Common Reasons for Ethereum Transaction Failures

There are several common errors that can cause Ethereum transactions to fail:

1. **Dropped and Replaced Error**: This error occurs when a transaction is dropped and replaced by a new one. For more information on dropped and replaced transactions, refer to [this link](https://info.etherscan.com/transaction-dropped-replaced/).

2. **Out of Gas Error**: This error occurs when the gas limit for a transaction is set too low. For a better understanding of gas limits, please read the following article: [Gas Limit Explained](https://ethgasstation.info/blog/gas-limit/).
