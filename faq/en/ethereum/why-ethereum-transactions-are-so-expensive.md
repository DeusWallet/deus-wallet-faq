# What Causes High Transaction Costs on the Ethereum Network?

The Ethereum blockchain facilitates various types of transactions, extending beyond simple transfers of ETH between addresses. These transactions include:

- Sending ETH from one address to another
- Transferring ERC20 tokens between addresses
- Swapping ERC20 tokens for other ERC20 tokens
- Borrowing ERC20 tokens from lending platforms

Transactions of diverse natures occur within the Ethereum ecosystem, each impacting transaction fees differently. The primary determinant of transaction costs is the complexity inherent in each transaction:

- Greater complexity translates to more computational steps.
- Increased computational steps correlate with higher transaction fees.

Considering this, the most straightforward and cost-effective transaction on Ethereum involves the direct transfer of ETH tokens.

Conversely, transactions involving token swaps incur higher costs due to their increased complexity, often exceeding the expense of basic ETH transfers. It's important to note that transaction fees remain unaffected by the volume of Ethereum or tokens transacted.
