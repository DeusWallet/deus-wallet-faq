# How to Track Ethereum Transaction Status

In the Deus wallet, users can easily keep tabs on their transaction statuses.

Upon initiating an Ethereum transaction, it will promptly show up with a 'pending' status in the Transactions tab.

Once the transaction is included in the blockchain, it transitions to 'sending' for the sender and 'receiving' for the recipient, marking its first confirmation.

The wallet app maintains the 'sending' and 'receiving' statuses until at least 10 blocks have been confirmed (equivalent to 10 confirmations). Subsequently, the status changes to 'completed,' denoted by a checkmark alongside a timestamp.

Besides monitoring within Deus, users can utilize publicly accessible Ethereum block explorers such as [https://etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io). By simply searching for the transaction ID on these platforms, users can also monitor their transaction status externally.
