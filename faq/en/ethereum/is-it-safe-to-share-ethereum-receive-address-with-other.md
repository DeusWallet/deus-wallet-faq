## Is it Secure to Disclose an Ethereum Receiving Address?

Although it's common practice for users to share their Ethereum payment addresses with those from whom they're anticipating payments, there are privacy considerations to bear in mind.

Sharing Ethereum addresses poses privacy risks, as the recipient could potentially view the ETH balance, along with all ERC20 token balances and past transactions associated with that address.

Consequently, some users maintain multiple Ethereum wallets, allocating them for different purposes. One wallet may be designated for transactions with others, while another serves as a long-term storage solution for assets not involved in peer-to-peer transactions.
