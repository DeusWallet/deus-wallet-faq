# What is the Typical Timeframe for an Ethereum Transaction to Finalize?

Similar to Bitcoin, the completion of an Ethereum transaction hinges on its inclusion in a block within the Ethereum blockchain.

Like Bitcoin, the duration of an Ethereum transaction varies based on network activity and sender-set fees. During periods of high Ethereum activity, users may need to offer higher fees to expedite transaction processing in subsequent blocks.

Deus provides an estimate of the requisite transaction fee to secure inclusion within upcoming blocks. Generally, a recommended fee should facilitate transaction completion within 10-20 minutes, though this is not guaranteed.

Should users opt for transaction fees significantly below the current Ethereum network average, transactions might linger in a pending state for hours or even days until network congestion alleviates.
