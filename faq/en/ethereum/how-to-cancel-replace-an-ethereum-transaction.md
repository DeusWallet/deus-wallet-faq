## How to Manage Ethereum Transactions

Once an Ethereum transaction has been confirmed and included in a block on the blockchain, it becomes immutable and cannot be canceled or altered. However, if a transaction is still pending and awaiting confirmation, there are methods to manage it.

Typically, Ethereum transactions are swiftly confirmed, usually within seconds or minutes, leaving little room for cancellation. However, during periods of high network activity, transactions may linger in a pending state for hours or even days. In such instances, it's possible to replace the pending transaction with a new one before it's confirmed.

To cancel a pending transaction, one approach is to send a new transaction to your own address with a higher transaction fee and the same nonce as the original transaction. While this method may cancel the initial transaction, success is not guaranteed and may not work consistently.

It's important to note that as of June 2021, some wallet apps, like Deus, do not offer control over the 'nonce' setting for transactions, and therefore cannot facilitate the cancellation of pending transactions. However, this functionality is expected to be incorporated in future updates.
