# What Causes an Ethereum Transaction to Stay Pending?

An Ethereum transaction might linger in a pending state due to two main factors:

1. Insufficient Transaction Fee: When the transaction fee falls below the network's average, it often leads to a prolonged pending status. Transactions typically proceed once network activity subsides.

2. Prior Pending Transaction: Ethereum processes transactions sequentially. If there's already a pending transaction from the same user, it must be finalized or replaced before subsequent transactions can proceed.
