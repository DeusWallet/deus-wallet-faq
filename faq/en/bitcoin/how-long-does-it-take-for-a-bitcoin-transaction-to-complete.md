# How long does it take for a Bitcoin transaction to go through?

Bitcoin transactions are added to the blockchain approximately every 10 minutes in blocks of around 1MB, which can accommodate thousands of transactions. The completion of a transaction occurs when the block containing it is added to the blockchain.

Typically, it takes about 10 minutes for a transaction to be included in the blockchain. However, this duration can vary, sometimes extending to 20-30 minutes or even longer. The variability is influenced by the level of activity on the Bitcoin network and the transaction fee set by the sender.

Here's a breakdown of the transaction process:

1. The sender initiates a transaction using the Deus wallet app. This transaction is immediately broadcast to the Bitcoin network and remains pending until a network node, also known as a miner, chooses to validate and include it in a block.

2. It's common for there to be more pending transactions than can fit into the 1MB blocks created every 10 minutes. This leads to a backlog of transactions, requiring network nodes to prioritize which transactions are included in the next block.

3. Given the limited space in each block, network nodes prioritize transactions with higher fees. These fees serve as an economic incentive for nodes to include transactions in blocks.

4. Transactions may linger in a 'pending' state for hours or even days, especially during periods of high network activity. They are eventually processed when network congestion eases, and the initially set transaction fees are deemed sufficient for inclusion in the next block.

5. To ensure timely transaction completion, senders should adjust their transaction fees based on the current network congestion.

By understanding these dynamics, users can better navigate the Bitcoin network and manage their transaction expectations.
