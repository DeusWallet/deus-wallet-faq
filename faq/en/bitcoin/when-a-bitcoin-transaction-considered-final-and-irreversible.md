## When is a Bitcoin Transaction Considered Final and Irreversible?

A Bitcoin transaction is considered confirmed once it is added to the blockchain. However, it is not deemed final and irreversible until several additional blocks are added to the blockchain.

To ensure a transaction is final and permanent, it is recommended to wait for 5 more blocks (approximately 50 minutes) after the block containing the original transaction.

Here are some guidelines for determining transaction finality:

- **Smaller Payments**: A transaction can be considered final as soon as it is included in the blockchain.
  
- **Mid-Sized Payments (above $10,000)**: It is recommended to wait for at least 3 blocks. The Deus wallet will display the transaction as final after 3 blocks.
  
- **Large Payments**: It is advisable to wait for 6 blocks, though users can feel fairly certain after 3 blocks.
