# Why is it impossible to immediately send newly received Bitcoins?

In Deus, in order for a transaction to utilize recently received Bitcoins, it must first garner 3 confirmations on the blockchain.

Once the transaction achieves 3 confirmations, Deus enables the use of the received funds in subsequent transactions.

Assuming the initial transaction included an adequate fee, this process typically takes 30-40 minutes from the time of transmission. Confirmation progress can be monitored within the Deus application or through a public Bitcoin block explorer using the transaction's ID.
