# How to Cancel a Bitcoin Transaction

Canceling a Bitcoin transaction is a bit more complex than just pressing a 'cancel' button.

Firstly, it's important to understand that once a transaction is included in the blockchain (i.e., it has received at least one confirmation), it cannot be canceled. Only unconfirmed (pending) transactions can potentially be canceled.

Before attempting to cancel a Bitcoin transaction, check if it has received any confirmations. Deus displays unconfirmed transactions with a 'pending' status. Once the transaction status changes to 'sending,' it can no longer be canceled.

If the transaction has no confirmations yet, there's still a chance (though not guaranteed) for the sender to cancel it, but this functionality must be built into the wallet app itself.

Currently, Deus does not offer this feature but may add it in the future.
