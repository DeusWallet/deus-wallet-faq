## Why Does the Bitcoin Payment Address Keep Changing?

In Deus, your address for receiving Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Dash will change after each received transaction in that cryptocurrency.

Deus does this to enhance user privacy. Using the same address for all incoming transactions would make your entire activity and balance publicly visible. By generating a new receive address for each transaction, it becomes harder to link these transactions to a single user.

All previously used addresses remain valid, and funds sent to any of these past addresses will still be received. The addresses do not expire.
