## Why Did the Bitcoin Balance Not Increase After Receiving Payment?

For a Bitcoin payment to be reflected in your wallet's balance, it must receive at least 3 confirmations.

Deus considers a payment final after it has received 3 confirmations on the network. This means that at least 2 additional blocks need to be added to the blockchain after the block containing the transaction. You can track this within the Deus app or via a public Bitcoin block explorer using the transaction ID.
