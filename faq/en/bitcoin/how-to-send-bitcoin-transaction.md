# How to Send a Bitcoin Transaction

To send Bitcoins to someone, the sender needs the recipient's Bitcoin address.

The full process is as follows:

1. The sender obtains the recipient's Bitcoin address.
2. They navigate to the Balance tab, click on Bitcoin, and select the 'send' option.
3. The sender enters the amount and the recipient's Bitcoin address.
4. They specify the transaction fee.
5. The sender clicks the Next button to proceed.
6. They review and confirm the transaction.
7. The sender can then monitor the transaction status from the Transactions list.

When sending Bitcoin via Deus, the transaction goes directly to the blockchain without passing through intermediaries.

Most cryptocurrency wallets cannot communicate directly with the Bitcoin blockchain and must route transactions through intermediaries.
