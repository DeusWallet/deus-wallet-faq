# Why does a Bitcoin transaction remain pending?

One frequent cause for a transaction to linger in a pending state for an extended period is network congestion coupled with a fee set below the average.

Transactions with extremely low fees, approaching zero, are expected to fail and be rejected promptly after initiation.

However, if the sender's chosen fee falls below the network's average due to a sudden surge in blockchain activity, the transaction is likely to experience a prolonged pending status before eventual processing. In some cases, this delay could persist for several days.
