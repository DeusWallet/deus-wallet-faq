# Understanding Cryptocurrency Swaps

Cryptocurrency swaps facilitated by Deus wallet enable users to exchange one cryptocurrency token for another through decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (DEXes).

A decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, or DEX, operates autonomously on smart contract-enabled blockchains like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. It allows individuals to privately and unconditionally exchange tokens.

Here are some key points about DEXes:

- DEXes facilitate the swapping/trading of cryptocurrency tokens.
- Trades on DEXes are non-custodial, meaning users retain control of their funds at all times.
- Users directly engage with the DEX when making trades.
- The DEX serves as both a maker and taker for any supported token trade.
- A 'swap fee' is typically charged by the DEX, ranging between %0.2 and %0.4.
- DEXes operate independently and autonomously.
- Access to DEXes is open and unconditional, allowing anyone to participate in token exchanges.
