# How to Exchange Cryptocurrency in Deus

To exchange one cryptocurrency for another in Deus, follow these steps:

1. Activate the cryptocurrency coin you wish to use for payment by navigating to the Balance tab and clicking the 'add coin' button if it's not already active.

2. Proceed to the Balance tab, click on the coin cell, and then select the swap icon.

3. On the resulting screen, you'll see two boxes. One allows you to choose the cryptocurrency coin you want to sell, and the other lets you select the cryptocurrency coin you want to buy.

4. Once both options are selected, Deus will display the real-time swap rate for the chosen coins along with trade details.

By default, Deus attempts to route the order through 1inch for optimal trade prices. However, users have the flexibility to change the default service provider to Uniswap or PancakeSwap if they prefer.
