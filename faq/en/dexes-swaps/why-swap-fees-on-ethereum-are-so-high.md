## Understanding the High Swap Fees on Ethereum

The Ethereum blockchain is currently experiencing significant congestion, leading to high transaction costs. As more users engage in transactions on the network, the associated fees rise accordingly.

At present, conducting even a basic transfer of ETH tokens, which is among the most affordable transaction types, can incur fees as high as $10 in ETH. Consequently, more intricate transactions, such as swaps, often surpass the $50 mark.

Considering this scenario, it becomes impractical from an economic standpoint to execute swaps on the Ethereum blockchain, particularly for smaller amounts. While a $100 transaction fee might not pose a significant obstacle for someone exchanging $10,000 worth of cryptocurrency, it can greatly impact those dealing with $500 or lesser sums.

Furthermore, it's essential to recognize that the transaction fees suggested by Deus represent the maximum anticipated cost. These fees are approximate and may differ from the actual amount paid upon completion of the transaction, typically being slightly lower than the estimated value.
