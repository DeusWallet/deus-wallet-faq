# Are there any restrictions on swap quantities?

There are no limitations on the amount of cryptocurrency users can swap, provided that there is adequate liquidity on a DEX.

Prior to conducting a swap transaction, users are strongly recommended to assess the associated risks.

It is worth noting that the liquidity available on a decentralized exchange might not be adequate to accommodate certain large trades, particularly those involving less popular tokens.

Consequently, users are urged to compare swap prices with those offered on other centralized exchanges (e.g., [Binance](https://binance.com)) before proceeding with a transaction.
