# Why is Deus exclusively supportive of DEXes?

The Deus wallet app is purposefully designed to operate independently from traditional financial structures, hence it does not incorporate any services tied to conventional finance ecosystems.

Consequently, the following options are unavailable:

- Purchasing cryptocurrency via credit card or bank deposit,
- Selling cryptocurrency for fiat currency,
- Exchanging cryptocurrency through conventional centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase.

To facilitate cryptocurrency transactions, Deus integrates with prominent decentralized exchanges, enabling users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies beyond the confines of traditional finance.

Decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges offer unrestricted access, operating around the clock and accessible to users worldwide.
