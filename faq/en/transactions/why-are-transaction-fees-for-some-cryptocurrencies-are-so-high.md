# Why Are Transaction Fees for Some Cryptocurrencies So High?

Transaction fees depend on multiple factors, with the most important being the demand and capacity of the blockchain network for a given cryptocurrency.

When many people are transacting on a cryptocurrency network with limited throughput, the network can become congested, causing average fees to rise. Transaction fees act as a priority mechanism when there are more transactions than the network can process, resulting in a backlog.

Transactions paying higher fees get prioritized, while those with low fees remain in the queue. Sending a transaction with a low fee during busy times likely results in the transaction staying pending for hours or days, or being rejected by the network.

Different cryptocurrency blockchains have varying throughput capacities and usage levels. Therefore, transaction fees tend to be much higher on popular blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which also have limited throughput.

Fees on busy blockchains can change significantly within hours depending on market events and news. Typically, blockchains where transactions are cheap either have high throughput (such as Solana or Binance Smart Chain) or low usage levels (such as Litecoin or Dogecoin).
