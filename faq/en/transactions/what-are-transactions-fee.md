# What Are Transaction Fees?

When sending cryptocurrency, the sender must pay a transaction fee to the underlying blockchain network. This fee is essential for the transaction to be accepted and included in the blockchain by one of the network nodes (miners).

The transaction fee goes directly to one of the random blockchain network nodes and is not associated with or handled by the Deus wallet team.
