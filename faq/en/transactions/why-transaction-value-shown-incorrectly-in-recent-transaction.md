# Why is a transaction value shown incorrectly in a recent transaction?

To accurately display the total transferred cryptocurrency amount in fiat (USD, EUR, etc.) for past transactions, Deus needs to know the valid exchange rate on the transaction date.

Currently, Deus relies on [CoinGecko](https://coingecko.com) for historical cryptocurrency rates. In the future, we plan to reference additional sources, including options to obtain historical rates from decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges.

If the historical exchange rate in the Unstoopable app is incorrect, the transaction amount shown in the transaction list will also be incorrect. In such cases, refer to the actual amount transferred in cryptocurrency.
