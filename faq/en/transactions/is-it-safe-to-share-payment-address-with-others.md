# Is it Safe to Share a Payment Address with Others?

Users need to share their payment address with anyone from whom they're expecting to receive payment.

Things to keep in mind:

- For fully public blockchains like Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, anyone who knows your address can see the entire transaction history and current token balances (ERC20, BEP20, etc.). These blockchains do not offer transaction privacy.

- On semi-anonymous blockchains like Bitcoin and its derivatives (Bitcoin Cash, Doge, Litecoin, etc.), sharing a payment address does not expose your past transactions or wallet balances to the sender. Most non-custodial wallets provide a new payment address after each successful incoming payment, enhancing privacy.

- Privacy risks are minimal when using privacy coins such as Zcash, Monero, or Dash, as these blockchains are designed to protect transaction and balance information.
