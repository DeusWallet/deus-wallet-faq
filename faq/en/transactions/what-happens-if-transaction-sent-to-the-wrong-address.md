# Can a Transaction Be Canceled?

Blockchain transactions are irreversible.

If someone mistakenly sends a payment to an incorrect address, there is no way to cancel a confirmed transaction (one that has been added to the blockchain) except by asking the recipient to return the funds.

However, if the payment is still pending and has not yet been added to the blockchain, there are potential ways to cancel it. The methods for doing this for Bitcoin and Ethereum are explained in the sections below.

Deus Wallet can validate destination addresses and warn a sender if the entered address doesn't match the typical format for a payment address on that blockchain. For example, the wallet won't allow you to send Bitcoin to an Ethereum address and vice versa.

Additionally, Deus can alert the sender if they mistype or enter an incomplete payment address.
