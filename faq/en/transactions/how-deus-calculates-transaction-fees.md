# How Does Deus Calculate Transaction Fees?

The Deus wallet app is designed to recommend the optimal transaction fee at any given moment. 100% of this fee goes directly to the network nodes and is not associated with Deus wallet in any way.

Deus does not charge any additional fees for sending, receiving, or swapping cryptocurrencies.

The transaction fee recommendations by Deus are based on recent blockchain activity. If a user selects a low fee, Deus will warn that the transaction may get stuck and remain pending for hours or even days.

It is recommended to set higher fees when sending large amounts or when a quick transaction is needed. Higher fees typically result in faster transaction processing.
