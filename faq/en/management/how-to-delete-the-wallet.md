# Deleting (Unlinking) Your Wallet:

To remove wallets and their associated data from Deus, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Settings menu, then go to the Manage Wallets section.
2. Locate the wallet you wish to delete and click on the 'more' button beside it to access its settings.
3. Within the settings screen, utilize the 'unlink' button to initiate the deletion process.

By following the above steps, the wallet will be removed from the app, and all its data will be erased as if it never existed. However, please note that this action does not delete any wallet transactions or balances stored on the blockchain, as it is not feasible to do so.

The unlink action specifically removes the private key associated with the wallet from the Deus app. To restore deleted wallets in the future, users will need the private key (mnemonic phrase) for each wallet, along with any passphrase it may have had. Without this information, it is impossible to regain access to a deleted wallet.
