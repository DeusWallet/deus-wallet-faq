# How to Make Wallets in Deus

Deus offers seamless management of numerous wallets, each capable of storing various cryptocurrencies.

To establish your initial wallet, simply click the "Create" button after navigating through the wallet welcome screens. This process takes just a few seconds and requires no further steps. Once your wallet is created, it's all set to go as long as you've completed the private key backup.

You can generate additional wallets via the 'Manage Wallets' section, which can be found in both the Balance and Settings tabs. There's no restriction on the number of wallets users can create within the Deus wallet.
