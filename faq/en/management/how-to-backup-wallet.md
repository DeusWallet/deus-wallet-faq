## How to Safeguard Your Wallet(s) with Backup

Backing up your wallet is a crucial step to ensure the security of your assets. Here's a simple guide to completing the backup process for each wallet within the Deus app:

1. Navigate to the Settings section and select "Manage Wallets."
2. Identify any wallets lacking backup completion by locating the red alert icon.
3. Tap the 'more' button adjacent to the wallet name.
4. Within the wallet settings screen, choose the "Backup Wallet" option.
5. Follow the provided backup steps diligently.

It's essential to note that funds cannot be received in wallets that lack backup. While this precaution may inconvenience some users, it significantly reduces the risk of operating wallets without adequate backup measures in place.

Each wallet's backup process entails recording a private key, typically in the form of a 12 to 24-word mnemonic phrase.

It's imperative to avoid saving a screenshot of the private key, as this practice poses security risks. Unauthorized access to the photo library by third-party applications, such as social media platforms, could compromise the confidentiality of the key.
