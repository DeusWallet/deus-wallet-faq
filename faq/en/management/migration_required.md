# MIGRATION REQUIRED

Your wallet was created using a non-standard method. While it works securely within the Deus app, it is not compatible with other standard-compliant wallet apps.

Therefore, you will not be able to restore this wallet in other apps. To ensure compatibility, it is recommended to set up a new wallet using an English word list and transfer all funds to this new wallet.

Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. Go to the Settings tab.
2. Select Manage Wallets.
3. Click on the Create button.
4. Make sure to backup the newly created wallet.
5. Transfer funds from the old wallet to the new wallet.

Until this process is complete, ensure you keep a backup of your old wallet as well.
