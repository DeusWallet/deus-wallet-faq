# Adding Coins to Your Wallet

To add a coin to your wallet, navigate to the Balance tab and locate the 'Add coin' button. Then, simply search for the desired coin.

If the coin you're looking for doesn't appear in the search results, you can manually add it by entering the token's smart contract address.
