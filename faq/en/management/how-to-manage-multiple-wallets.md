# How to Manage Multiple Wallets

Deus simplifies the management of unlimited multi-coin crypto wallets.

Users can manage and operate as many wallets as they need, with each wallet serving as a distinct asset portfolio. For example, one wallet can be dedicated to long-term investments, while another is used for payments.

The Balance tab on Deus always displays the currently active wallet. To switch between wallets, users can:

- Use the wallet switcher button located at the top left of the Balance tab.
- Access Manage Wallets from the wallet app's Settings screen.
- Double-click (iOS) or tap and hold (Android) on the Balance tab icon while on the Balance screen.

When managing multiple wallets, users should complete the backup procedure for all enabled wallets.

**Tip:** For those planning to operate multiple wallets, consider setting up an unlimited number of wallets using the same mnemonic phrase (private key) but a different passphrase for each wallet. This approach simplifies the management, operation, and backup of wallets.
