It appears that this wallet was created using a non-English word list and/or contains symbols in the passphrase other than the following:

A-Z a-z 0-9 '"`&/?!:;.,~*$=+-{}<>\_#@|%

If your wallet balance and transactions are displayed correctly, no action is needed. However, if you do not see a balance or transactions, please follow these steps to restore your wallet using the non-standard restore option:

1. Go to the Settings tab.
2. Select Manage Wallets.
3. Click on the Restore button.
4. Choose Non-standard Restore.
5. Follow the restore instructions.

Once the restoration is complete, your balance and transactions should be visible.

After this process, the wallet app will display another alert with recommended steps to transfer your funds to a standard-compliant wallet.
