# Who is Building Deus?

Deus was founded in 2022.

- We are a 12-person engineering and creative team passionate about borderless fintech and DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations).

- Our team has been involved in various SaaS ventures and fintech since 2013, fully transitioning to the cryptocurrency and fintech domain in 2017.

- This shift was driven by the limitations and challenges we faced with traditional finance, both in business and personal contexts.

- The vision of creating a decentralized asset storage and management tool, free from the constraints of traditional finance, was irresistible to us.
