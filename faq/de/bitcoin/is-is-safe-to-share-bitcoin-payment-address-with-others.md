# Is it Safe to Share a Bitcoin Payment Address with Others?

Yes, sharing a Bitcoin address with others is necessary to receive payments.

However, if the same address is repeatedly used for receiving transactions, anyone paying the user can potentially look up past transactions involving that address on the Bitcoin blockchain. This may expose the user's balance.

To address this issue for Bitcoin and Bitcoin-based cryptocurrencies, wallets like Deus implement a privacy-preserving mechanism that allows Bitcoin wallets to use an unlimited number of addresses. 

All these addresses are derived from the wallet's private key. Therefore, when a user migrates from one wallet app to another, the destination app can derive all addresses the wallet ever had and check which of them have received transactions.
