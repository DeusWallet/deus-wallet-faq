# Supported DEXes in Deus Wallet

Deus wallet currently extends support to the following decentralized exchanges:

- [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org)
  - Supported Trades: ETH <> ERC20 / ERC20 <> ERC20

- [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance)
  - Supported Assets: BNB <> BEP20 / BEP20 <> BEP20

- [1inch Aggregator](https://app.1inch.io/)
  - Supported Assets: ETH <> ERC20, ERC20 <> ERC20, BNB <> BEP20, BEP20 <> BEP20

The integration of these DEXes facilitates asset trading within a single blockchain ecosystem, allowing transactions such as exchanging Ethereum (ETH) for various ERC20 tokens like USDT, UNI, or AAVE via Uniswap, and trading Binance Smart Chain assets (BEP20) through PancakeSwap.

The 1inch aggregator offers a unique feature by enabling traders to split a single trade order among multiple exchanges within the Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain ecosystem to achieve the best possible price.

In the future, Deus aims to finalize integration with [Thorchain](https://thorchain.org), a decentralized exchange facilitating cryptocurrency trades across different blockchains.

Thorchain integration will provide seamless decentralized token swaps among various asset types, including BTC, ETH, LTC, ZEC, BCH, BNB, ERC20, and BEP20 tokens.
