# What Risks Come with Utilizing WalletConnect?

It's crucial to understand that WalletConnect serves as a conduit linking the user's wallet (such as Deus) to the DeFi service website.

When a user triggers any transaction on the DeFi service website necessitating a fund transfer, the Deus wallet prompts the user with a confirmation window to approve or deny the transaction. However, the Deus wallet lacks the ability to discern the transaction's context and merely facilitates the transaction's approval or denial.

Choosing a DeFi website from reputable sources is imperative. In the event of a malicious takeover of the service's website, there exists a potential risk of users being presented with a confirmation window that diverges from their intentions without their awareness. Thus, it's advisable to exclusively utilize well-established and widely trusted DeFi services.
