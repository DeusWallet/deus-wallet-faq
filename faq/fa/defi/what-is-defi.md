# Understanding Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

In conventional finance, also known as centralized finance, intermediaries play a pivotal role between users and services. Users' access and involvement in these services are contingent upon regulations imposed by the respective intermediaries.

- Banks impose minimum balance requirements, withdrawal limits, and transfer restrictions on savings accounts.
- Credit card issuers reserve the right to terminate services if suspicious activities are detected.
- Investment opportunities are often exclusive, catering mainly to the affluent members of society.

Decentralized Finance (DeFi), on the other hand, represents a spectrum of products that offer financial services without reliance on a central authority.

- Bitcoin serves as a decentralized platform for value transfer, eliminating the need for permission to transact on the network.
- Ethereum facilitates the creation of cryptocurrency-powered financial services and the utilization of services developed by others.
- Non-custodial wallets like Deus empower users to store and access their assets without depending on a third party.

Presently, a significant portion of DeFi services operates on the Ethereum blockchain and is commonly referred to as Decentralized Applications (DApps).

These DApps typically exhibit the following attributes:

- Accessibility: Available to anyone with an internet connection and some cryptocurrency, regardless of geographical location, age, or experience.
- Resistance to Censorship: DeFi services operate on a distributed blockchain network, ensuring uninterrupted access for users worldwide.
- Non-Custodial: Users retain complete control over their assets without relying on a custodial entity.
- Trustless: Transparent and open-source, DeFi services operate within predefined rules, eliminating the need for trust in service providers.
- Independence: DeFi services are generally not owned by a single entity, often moderated by a decentralized group of semi-anonymous entities.

With these principles in mind, the aim of DeFi is to redefine global financial instruments by establishing open, censorship-resistant, decentralized alternatives.

Here's a simplified overview of the development, funding, and governance processes within DeFi:

- DeFi projects are expected to have open-source code, allowing third-party engineers to inspect and utilize various components.
- Funding is typically raised through token sales, such as Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), where specific cryptocurrency tokens are sold, representing governance rights or profit shares.
- Governance of DeFi projects usually involves a decentralized group of entities, often making decisions through proposal submissions and voting mechanisms.
