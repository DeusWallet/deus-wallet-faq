## Monitoring Transactions Conducted through WalletConnect

Transactions conducted via WalletConnect, including typical token transfers and swaps, are conveniently tracked in the Transactions tab.

In this list, these transactions will be labeled as 'Contract Calls', sometimes accompanied by a descriptive title such as 'Sushiswap Pool Deposit'.

To monitor the status of these transactions, you can utilize the Deus wallet app or access a public blockchain explorer like [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io) using the transaction ID.
